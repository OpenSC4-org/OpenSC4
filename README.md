# OpenSC4
> Open source reimplementation of SimCity 4.

This project aims to create a working open source "clone" of
SimCity 4 that would be able to take advantage of modern hardware
and run on other platforms.

# Setup
1. Install Godot
2. Git clone and import the project into Godot
3. Run

After that, the game will prompt for your SimCity 4 installation
directory and load into a region view.

# Contributing
We need help on every front for this recreation.
So offering any kind of contribution would be appreciated!
