Individual Network RULs:
	use edge-shape definitions to define what object to render there, 
	it doesn't specify wether it is an FSH or an S3D or an Exemplar

my approach will be to store the RUL information in nested dicts
	dict[W = dict[N = dict[E = dict[S = IID]]]]
This data is then used to add the FSH's to texturearray(s)
	for S3D objects I'd need to initialize them and get their FSH's
	when adding FSH's to the array I ofcourse need to keep track of what layer is what FSH
	that record should also allow me to not load duplicate FSH's since they are reused
This data is then used to define a dict of the same shape with TransitTile objects 
	that store path and texarrlayer data
	
Edge definitions come in the following forms:
	per side w, n, e, s:
 - 00 = disconnected
 - 01 = diagonal 45deg left (as viewed from edge to center)
 - 02 = straight
 - 03 = diagonal 45deg right
 - 04 = shared median for 2-tile networks
 - 11 = transition from 01 to 02, diag to straight
 - 13 = transition as 11 but other diagonal
rails also use:
 - 21: N-0x03187F00,0,0
 - 22: S-0x03002200,0,0
 - 23: E-0x03001C00,0,0

 - 32: S-0x03031700,0,0
 - 42: S-0x03034b00,0,0
 - 52: N-0x0306BD00,0,0
 - 62: E-0x03014E00,0,0
 - 72: N-0x0312FF00,0,0
21 to 52 describe sides with in-between diagonals where 62 and 72 describe sides with double diagonals from two directions with 72 including a straight aswell
 - ?: specifies edges that are irrelevant to tiles being defined.

My observation:
